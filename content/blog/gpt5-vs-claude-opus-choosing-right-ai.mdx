| Creative writing | Claude Opus 4.5 | More natural, nuanced style |
| Analysis & extraction | Tie | Both excellent |
| Customer service | Claude Opus 4.5 | More empathetic responses |
| Complex reasoning | Claude Opus 4.5 | Extended thinking capability |
| API integrations | GPT-5.2 | Richer ecosystem |
| Cost-sensitive | GPT-5-mini | Cheapest good option |

## The Real Differences

### Coding Ability

**GPT-5.2**:
- Stronger at complex logic
- Better function calling
- More accurate with edge cases
- Excellent debugging suggestions

**Claude Opus 4.5**:
- Good code generation
- Better code explanations
- Catches security issues more often
- Sometimes over-cautious

**Our recommendation**: GPT-5.2 for production code, Claude for code reviews.

### Writing Quality

**GPT-5.2**:
- Efficient, gets to the point
- Good structure
- Can feel mechanical at scale

**Claude Opus 4.5**:
- More natural flow
- Better tone matching
- Stronger creative tasks
- Longer context awareness

**Our recommendation**: Claude for anything user-facing, GPT for internal docs.

### Reasoning

**GPT-5.2**:
- Fast reasoning
- Good for straightforward problems
- Less prone to overthinking

**Claude Opus 4.5**:
- "Extended thinking" for complex problems
- Shows its work
- Better at nuanced situations
- Can be slow when thinking deeply

**Our recommendation**: Claude for complex decisions, GPT for quick queries.

### Tool Use & APIs

**GPT-5.2**:
- Conversations API (excellent)
- Native function calling
- Web search built-in
- Image generation (DALL-E)
- TTS and Whisper integration

**Claude Opus 4.5**:
- Computer use capability
- MCP protocol support
- Good function calling
- No native image generation

**Our recommendation**: GPT if you need the ecosystem, Claude if you need MCP.

## Cost Comparison

| Model | Input/1M tokens | Output/1M tokens | Best For |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| GPT-5-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | High volume, simple tasks |
| GPT-5.2 | $2.50 | $10.00 | Standard workloads |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.25 | $1.25 | Quick, cheap tasks |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3.00 | $15.00 | Balanced performance |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $15.00 | $75.00 | Maximum capability |

**Cost calculation example** (10,000 queries/month, avg 500 tokens each):

| Model | Monthly Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| GPT-5-mini | $4.50 |
| GPT-5.2 | $62.50 |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $7.50 |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $450.00 |

**Our approach**: Use mini/haiku for 80% of queries, escalate to full models when needed.

## Real-World Testing

We ran the same 100 prompts through both models across categories:

### Customer Support Responses
- GPT-5.2: 82% acceptable
- Claude Opus 4.5: 91% acceptable
- Winner: Claude (more empathetic)

### Code Generation
- GPT-5.2: 88% working code
- Claude Opus 4.5: 79% working code
- Winner: GPT (fewer bugs)

### Creative Writing
- GPT-5.2: 76% quality score
- Claude Opus 4.5: 89% quality score
- Winner: Claude (more natural)

### Data Extraction
- GPT-5.2: 94% accuracy
- Claude Opus 4.5: 93% accuracy
- Winner: Tie

### Instruction Following
- GPT-5.2: 87% exact compliance
- Claude Opus 4.5: 92% exact compliance
- Winner: Claude (follows nuances better)

## Integration Complexity

### GPT-5.2

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

// Simple, well-documented
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-5.2",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }]
});
```

Pros:
- Excellent documentation
- Large community
- Many integrations available
- Stable API

### Claude Opus 4.5

```typescript
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

const anthropic = new Anthropic();

const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model: "claude-opus-4-5",
  max_tokens: 4096,
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello" }]
});
```

Pros:
- Clean SDK
- Good documentation
- MCP support
- Consistent API

**Integration verdict**: Both are easy. GPT has more community resources.

## When to Use Each

### Use GPT-5.2 When:

1. **Building integrations** - Better ecosystem, tools, APIs
2. **Code-heavy applications** - More accurate code generation
3. **Cost matters** - GPT-5-mini is cheapest quality option
4. **You need multimodal** - Image gen, TTS, Whisper all native
5. **Speed is critical** - Generally faster responses

### Use Claude Opus 4.5 When:

1. **User-facing conversations** - More natural, empathetic
2. **Creative content** - Better writing quality
3. **Complex reasoning needed** - Extended thinking shines
4. **Following nuanced instructions** - Better at edge cases
5. **MCP integration** - Native protocol support

### Use Both When:

1. **You want redundancy** - Fallback between providers
2. **Different tasks need different strengths** - Route appropriately
3. **A/B testing** - Compare performance on your data
4. **Best quality regardless of cost** - Use each where it excels

## Our Production Stack

For most projects, we use:

```typescript
// Router logic
function selectModel(task: string): string {
  if (task.includes('code')) return 'gpt-5.2';
  if (task.includes('write') || task.includes('creative')) return 'claude-opus-4-5';
  if (task.includes('simple') || task.includes('quick')) return 'gpt-5-mini';
  return 'gpt-5.2'; // Default
}
```

This gives us:
- 50% cost reduction vs using Opus everywhere
- Better quality per task
- Redundancy if one provider has issues

## Making Your Decision

### For Startups

Start with GPT-5-mini for everything. It's cheap and good enough.

Upgrade to GPT-5.2 when:
- Quality issues appear
- You need function calling
- Complex tasks fail

Add Claude when:
- User feedback wants "more natural" responses
- Creative quality matters

### For Enterprise

Start with GPT-5.2 for reliability and ecosystem.

Add Claude for:
- Customer-facing applications
- Content generation
- Complex analysis

Consider multi-model:
- Route based on task type
- Use cost-appropriate models
- Build fallback systems
