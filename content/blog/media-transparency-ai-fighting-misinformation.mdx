# Media Transparency AI: Fighting Misinformation with Technology

Every news article has an agenda. Pulse Wire helps you see it.

## The Problem

Media manipulation is everywhere:
- Ownership hidden behind corporate structures
- Outlets saying one thing, doing another
- Propaganda disguised as news
- Readers with no tools to evaluate sources

Trust in media is at historic lows. But most people can't spend hours researching every source.

## The Solution: Pulse Wire

An AI platform that provides:
1. **Ownership Tracking**: Who actually controls this outlet?
2. **Hypocrisy Detection**: When outlets contradict themselves
3. **Propaganda Scoring**: How manipulative is this content?
4. **Story Newsstand**: Same story, different sources, side by side

**The goal**: Not to tell people what to think, but to give them information to decide for themselves.

## Feature Deep Dives

### Follow the Money

Every major outlet has complex ownership:
- Parent companies
- Board members with conflicts
- Advertisers with influence
- Political connections

**What Pulse Wire shows**:
```
Outlet: Example News Network
├── Parent: MegaCorp Holdings
│   ├── Owner: Investment Firm A (37%)
│   └── Owner: Investment Firm B (28%)
├── Major Advertisers: Pharma Co, Tech Giant
├── Board Connections: Senator X, Industry Lobbyist Y
└── Political Donations: $2.3M to Party Z
```

**Why it matters**: When an outlet covers their parent company's industry, you should know.

### Hypocrisy Checker

The AI compares:
- Current coverage vs. historical positions
- Treatment of similar events for different parties
- Stated editorial policies vs. actual content

**Example output**:
```
Contradiction Detected:
- 2023: "Budget deficits threaten national security"
- 2025: "Deficit spending necessary for growth"
- Context: Change correlates with administration change
```

### Propaganda Analysis

Not all persuasion is propaganda. The AI distinguishes:

| Technique | Example | Score Impact |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Emotional manipulation | "Devastating betrayal" | +15 |
| False dichotomy | "Either you support X or you hate Y" | +20 |
| Cherry-picked data | Citing outlier studies | +10 |
| Anonymous sources | "Sources say" without context | +5 |
| Loaded language | Neutral: "said" vs. Loaded: "admitted" | +5 |

**Output**: Propaganda score from 0-100 with specific examples highlighted.

### Story Newsstand

Same event, multiple perspectives:
- Left-leaning coverage
- Right-leaning coverage
- International coverage
- Wire services (AP, Reuters)

**Why it helps**: See what's emphasized, omitted, and framed differently.

### AI Components

**GPT-5.2 for**:
- Content analysis
- Contradiction detection
- Propaganda technique identification

**Custom fine-tuned models for**:
- Source reliability scoring
- Bias classification
- Entity extraction

### Data Sources

- News APIs (NewsAPI, GDELT)
- Ownership databases (SEC filings, corporate records)
- Historical archives (Wayback Machine API)
- Political donation records (FEC data)

### Propaganda Detection Prompt

```typescript
const prompt = `Analyze this article for propaganda techniques:

${articleText}

Identify specific instances of:
1. Emotional manipulation - appeals to fear, anger, hope without evidence
2. False dichotomies - presenting only two options when more exist
3. Cherry-picked evidence - using outliers, ignoring contradicting data
4. Loaded language - words that carry implicit judgments
5. Unsubstantiated claims - assertions without evidence or sources
6. Appeal to authority - citing credentials instead of evidence
7. Bandwagon - "everyone knows" or "most people think"

For each technique found, provide:
- Exact quote from the article
- Technique name
- Severity (1-10)
- Brief explanation

Return as JSON.`;
```

## Challenges We Solved

### 1. Ownership Data Is Hidden

Corporate structures are designed to obscure.

**Solution**: Multiple data sources, entity resolution, and inference from public filings.

### 2. Bias Is Subjective

What one person calls bias, another calls truth.

**Solution**: Focus on measurable patterns, not ideology. Compare coverage, don't rate "correctness."

### 3. Scale

Thousands of articles per day from hundreds of sources.

**Solution**: Tiered analysis—quick scoring for all, deep analysis for flagged content.

### 4. Accuracy Matters

False accusations of propaganda cause real harm.

**Solution**: Confidence scores, human review for edge cases, transparency about methodology.

## Impact

Early results:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Articles analyzed | 50,000+/month |
| Sources tracked | 500+ outlets |
| Ownership chains mapped | 2,000+ |
| User accuracy rating | 87% agree with analysis |

### User Feedback

> "I read the same outlet for years. Pulse Wire showed me they flip positions depending on who's in power. Eye-opening." — User

> "I don't always agree with the analysis, but having the ownership information changed how I read news." — User

## Ethical Considerations

### What We Don't Do

- **Rate truth**: We don't say what's true/false
- **Block content**: We inform, not censor
- **Take political sides**: Analysis applies equally to all

### What We're Careful About

- **Transparency**: Our methodology is documented
- **Appeals**: Users can dispute analysis
- **Bias in AI**: We audit our own models for bias

## Business Model

Currently free for public use. Future:
- API access for researchers
- Enterprise media monitoring
- Newsroom tools

## Build Similar Tools?

We help organizations build:
- Content analysis systems
- Media monitoring platforms
- Bias detection tools
- Research infrastructure
