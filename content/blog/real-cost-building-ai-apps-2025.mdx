# The Real Cost of Building AI Apps in 2025

After shipping 30+ AI applications, I can tell you exactly what things cost. No vague ranges. Real numbers from real projects.

## The Short Answer

| Project Type | Budget Range | Timeline |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Simple AI MVP | $15,000-25,000 | 2-3 weeks |
| Full AI Product | $40,000-80,000 | 6-10 weeks |
| Enterprise AI System | $100,000-300,000 | 3-6 months |

Now let's break down where that money actually goes.

## Development Costs

### In-House vs Agency

**Building in-house**:
- Senior AI/ML Engineer: $150-250K/year
- Senior Full-Stack Developer: $120-180K/year
- Designer: $80-120K/year
- Time to hire and ramp up: 3-6 months

**Working with an agency** (like us):
- Fixed project cost: $15K-80K
- Timeline: 2-10 weeks
- No hiring, no overhead, no ramp-up

**The math**: For a single project, agency is almost always cheaper. For continuous AI development, consider hybrid approaches.

### Our Pricing Model

| Package | Price | Includes | Timeline |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|
| AI MVP | $15,000-25,000 | Core functionality, basic UI, deployment | 2-3 weeks |
| Full Product | $40,000-60,000 | MVP + polish, analytics, iteration | 4-6 weeks |
| Enterprise | $80,000+ | Custom requirements, integration, support | 8+ weeks |

## API and Infrastructure Costs

This is where most people underestimate.

### OpenAI API Costs (GPT-5.2)

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Typical Monthly |
|-------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| GPT-5-mini | $0.15/1M tokens | $0.60/1M tokens | $50-500 |
| GPT-5.2 | $2.50/1M tokens | $10/1M tokens | $200-2,000 |
| GPT-5.2 + Vision | $5/1M tokens | $15/1M tokens | $500-5,000 |

**Real example**: Our conversational AI app with 10,000 active users costs approximately $800/month in API fees.

### Claude API Costs (Anthropic)

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Claude Opus 4.5 | $15/1M tokens | $75/1M tokens |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | $3/1M tokens | $15/1M tokens |
| Claude Haiku 4.5 | $0.25/1M tokens | $1.25/1M tokens |

### Infrastructure

| Service | Monthly Cost | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Vercel Pro | $20/month | Hosting, CDN |
| Database (Supabase) | $25-100/month | Data storage |
| Vector DB (Pinecone) | $70-200/month | RAG applications |
| Monitoring | $30-100/month | Analytics, errors |

**Total infrastructure for a typical app**: $150-500/month

## Hidden Costs Nobody Mentions

### 1. Fine-Tuning Data

If you need custom model behavior:
- Data collection: $2,000-10,000
- Labeling: $0.05-0.50 per example
- Fine-tuning compute: $500-5,000

### 2. App Store Fees

- Apple Developer: $99/year
- Google Play: $25 one-time
- Apple's 30% cut on subscriptions (15% after year 1)

### 3. Ongoing Maintenance

AI apps aren't "set and forget":
- Model updates when APIs change: 4-8 hours quarterly
- Bug fixes and improvements: 4-8 hours monthly
- Security updates: 2-4 hours monthly

**Budget 10-15% of initial development cost annually for maintenance.**

### 4. Compliance and Legal

- Privacy policy: $500-2,000 (lawyer)
- Terms of service: $500-1,500
- GDPR/CCPA compliance: $2,000-10,000
- AI-specific disclosures: Varies by jurisdiction

## Real Project Budgets

### Project 1: SheGPT (Consumer AI App)

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Development | $18,000 |
| Design | $3,000 |
| API costs (first 3 months) | $450 |
| App Store | $99 |
| **Total to Launch** | **$21,549** |

### Project 2: Conversational Payments Agent

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Development | $45,000 |
| Integration (payment systems) | $12,000 |
| Security audit | $8,000 |
| API costs (first 3 months) | $2,400 |
| Legal/compliance | $5,000 |
| **Total to Launch** | **$72,400** |

### Project 3: Enterprise Document Processing

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Development | $85,000 |
| Custom model training | $15,000 |
| Integration | $25,000 |
| Security & compliance | $20,000 |
| Infrastructure (first year) | $12,000 |
| **Total to Launch** | **$157,000** |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Model Selection

Don't use GPT-5.2 for everything. Our approach:
- Simple queries: GPT-5-mini (10x cheaper)
- Complex reasoning: GPT-5.2
- Creative tasks: Claude Opus 4.5

**Savings**: 50-70% on API costs

### 2. Caching

Cache common responses. If 30% of queries are similar, cache them.

**Savings**: 30% on API costs

### 3. Prompt Engineering

Better prompts = fewer tokens = lower costs. We typically reduce token usage by 40% through prompt optimization.

### 4. Start with MVP

Don't build everything at once. Our recommended approach:
1. Ship MVP ($15-25K)
2. Validate with users (1 month)
3. Iterate based on data ($10-20K)
4. Scale what works ($20-40K)

**Total savings vs building everything upfront**: 30-50%

## What You Should Budget

For a serious AI product launch:

| Category | Budget |
|----------|--------|
| Development (MVP) | $20,000-40,000 |
| Design | $3,000-8,000 |
| Infrastructure (first year) | $2,000-6,000 |
| API costs (first year) | $3,000-24,000 |
| Legal/compliance | $2,000-10,000 |
| Maintenance (first year) | $3,000-6,000 |
| **Total First Year** | **$33,000-94,000** |
