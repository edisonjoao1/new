# Pet Health AI: How Video Analysis is Saving Pets' Lives

A dog owner recorded 30 seconds of video. Our AI noticed a limp they hadn't seen. The vet found early-stage arthritis. Treatment started before it became severe.

This is Pet Health Scan.

## The Problem

Pet owners often miss early warning signs:
- Subtle changes in gait
- Slight behavioral differences
- Early symptoms hidden by fur
- Animals hiding discomfort

By the time issues become obvious, treatment is harder and more expensive.

## The Solution

Pet Health Scan uses AI video analysis to:
1. Analyze how pets move and behave
2. Compare against patterns of healthy animals
3. Flag potential concerns
4. Recommend when to see a vet

**Not a replacement for veterinary care. An early warning system.**

## How It Works

### Video Capture

Users record 15-60 seconds of their pet:
- Walking across a room
- Playing normally
- Resting

The app guides them on what to capture for best analysis.

### AI Analysis

We use Gemini 3.0's video analysis capabilities:

```
Video Input → Frame Analysis → Behavior Detection → Health Indicators → Recommendations
```

The AI examines:
- **Gait patterns**: Limping, favoring one side, unusual posture
- **Energy levels**: Lethargy compared to species norms
- **Breathing**: Rapid, labored, or irregular breathing
- **Visible symptoms**: Discharge, swelling, skin issues
- **Behavioral cues**: Pain indicators, discomfort signs

### Results Delivery

Users receive:
- Observations (what the AI saw)
- Potential concerns (if any)
- Urgency level (monitor / schedule vet / urgent)
- Specific recommendations

## Real Results

Since launch:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Videos analyzed | 15,000+ |
| Early issue detection | 12% of scans |
| Vet visits prompted | 1,800+ |
| User satisfaction | 4.7/5 stars |

### Case Studies

**Case 1: Early Arthritis Detection**
- Owner: "I thought my dog was just getting older"
- AI noticed: Slight hesitation when rising, weight shifting
- Outcome: Early treatment, maintained mobility

**Case 2: Respiratory Issue**
- Owner recorded playtime
- AI noticed: Elevated breathing rate post-activity
- Outcome: Heart condition diagnosed early

**Case 3: Skin Condition**
- Video showed scratching behavior
- AI noticed: Pattern suggesting allergic reaction
- Outcome: Identified food allergy, diet adjusted

## The Technology

### Why Gemini for Video?

Gemini 3.0's video analysis offers:
- Native video understanding (not frame-by-frame)
- Context across the entire clip
- Fast processing (results in seconds)
- Cost-effective for consumer app

### Architecture

```
iOS App → API Server → Gemini 3.0 Pro → Results

       Video Optimization
       (compress, normalize)
```

### The Analysis Prompt

We engineered a detailed prompt that:
- Focuses on observable indicators
- Avoids speculation beyond evidence
- Always includes appropriate disclaimers
- Provides actionable recommendations

### Cost Structure

Per analysis:
- Video processing: ~$0.01
- AI analysis: ~$0.02
- Total: ~$0.03 per scan

Sustainable at scale with freemium model.

## Building for Pet Owners

### User Experience Principles

1. **Immediate value**: Results in under 30 seconds
2. **Clear language**: No medical jargon
3. **Appropriate caution**: Never replace vet advice
4. **Actionable output**: What to do next

### Trust Building

Pet owners are protective. We built trust through:
- Transparent limitations
- Always recommending vet consultation for concerns
- Clear disclaimers on every result
- No false promises about accuracy

## What This Means for AI Applications

Pet Health Scan demonstrates:

### 1. Video AI Is Ready
Real-time video analysis is now practical for consumer apps. Not just in labs.

### 2. Domain-Specific AI Works
Generic AI can't match domain-trained models. Our pet health prompts outperform generic "describe this video."

### 3. Augmentation, Not Replacement
The best AI applications enhance human judgment, not replace it. We flag concerns; vets diagnose.

### 4. Cost Economics Have Shifted
A year ago, this would cost $0.50 per analysis. Now it's $0.03. The economics unlock new use cases.

## Future Development

We're expanding:
- **Multiple species**: Currently dogs and cats; adding birds, rabbits
- **Longitudinal tracking**: Compare videos over time
- **Vet integration**: Share reports directly with veterinarians
- **Training data**: Partnering with vet schools for more training data

## Build Something Similar?

Video AI applications are our specialty. We've built:
- Pet health analysis
- Media content analysis
- Quality control systems
- Sports performance analysis
